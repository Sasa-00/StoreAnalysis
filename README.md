*STUDENT PROJECT*

in this project i made three graphs:
  *Total sales per mont - to see which month had the best sales*,
  *Total sales per city - to see which city had the best sales*,
  *Bestseller products - to see which product had the best sales*.
All of that informations i pulled from Excel(.csv) datas, which were divided into different months through the year, with pandas library.
